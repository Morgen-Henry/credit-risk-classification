# Credit Risk Analysis Report

Background: In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis aims to evaluate if supervised learning models can accurately predict whether a loan is high-risk or healthy.

## The Results
Original Data (rounded scores)
* Accuracy score: 94%
* Precision score: 100% (healthy loans) and 87% (high-risk loans)
* Recall score: 100% (healthy loans) and 89% (high-risk loans)

Resampled Data (rounded scores)
* Accuracy score: 100%
* Precision score: 100% (healthy loans) and 87% (high-risk loans)
* Recall score: 100% (healthy loans) and 100% (high-risk loans)

## A Summary
I recommend this company uses the resampled data model. The accuracy score is 100% and we can assume that this model's predictions are accurate.
